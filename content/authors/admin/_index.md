I am a third-year PhD student in Computational and Applied Mathematics at University of Chicago, advised by Professor [Bryon Aragam](http://www.bryonaragam.com). My research focuses on learning model structure from high-dimensional data and its related applications, such as parameter tuning and model interpretability, with theoretical guarantees.
